Specifically, I need, for the untreated fraction ecoSpold:
  "geography",         (string, code representing the country, from the "simplified_data_entry" page)
  "untreated_fraction" (float between 0 and 1, from the UNICEF spreadsheet, a dummy value from your part would do for now)

  "CSO_particulate"    (float between 0 and 1, directly from the tool)
  "CSO_dissolved"      (float between 0 and 1, directly from the tool)

  "WW_properties"      (dict with ecoinvent_property_id: amount_in_kg_per_m3, taken from the "simplified_data_entry" page)
  "PV"                 (float, the production volume from the "simplified_data_entry" page)
  "CSO_amounts"        (dict of calculated discharged amounts. I will convert these to emissions to the environment)
