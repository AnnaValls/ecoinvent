(1) Total COD (COD)
(2) Filtered COD (sCOD)
(3) Total TKN
(4) Total P
(5) Influent VSS
(6) Influent TSS

(a) Unbiod. soluble COD fraction (USO, fSus)
(b) Unbiod. particulate COD      (UPO, fSup)
(c) RBCOD fraction of total COD  (BSO=VFA+FBSO, fS’bs)
(d) Acetate fraction of RBCOD    (VFA/BSO, fSbs’a)

(i) COD/VSS ratio of the UPO (and biomass) – we can use f_cv,UPO = 1.42gCOD/gVSS

The 6 concentrations are measurements (I don’t think VFA will be measured).
The 4 fractions are user estimates.
The 1 mass ratio can be hard coded in the tool.

Basically the M&E procedure uses the bCOD, nbsCOD, nbpCOD, nbpVSS and iTSS as
inputs for BOD removal and nitrification,
with additionally %RBCOD for N removal and VFA/RBCOD for bioP removal.

Then from M&E pg 757:

bCOD = COD*(1-f_Sus-f_Sup)

bsCOD = sCOD - COD * f_Sus

(This is contrary to M&E because here we are saying sbCOD=rbCOD=sCOD - nbsCOD)

nbsCOD=f_Sus * COD
nbpCOD=f_Sup * COD

nbpVSS=nbpCOD/f_cv,UPO

VFA=f_Sbs’a * rbCOD
