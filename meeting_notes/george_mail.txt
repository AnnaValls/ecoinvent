Dear Pascal et al.,

I have only worked with AD of concentrated sludges generated by mainstream WW
treatment.
I have not worked with mainsteam WWT AD where the mainsteam WW is treated by AD.
However, what I can do is prepare some a simple stoichiometric equations based
on the activated sludge WW characterization we already have and assume…..
(1)    90% conversion of fermentable biodegradable soluble organics (FBSO) as
COD, i.e. 10% FBSO remaining in effluent (this % can be a user selection). The
purpose of this is to account for some bioprocess generated soluble organics in
the effluent (e.g. residual VFA).
(2)    100% conversion of biodegradable particulate organics (BPO) as COD – BPO
accumulates in AD in the sludge bed and so remains in AD for duration of solids
retention time (SRT).
(3)    100% of biodegraded FBSO and BPO COD converted to AD biomass, which adds
to the accumulated Unbiodegradable Particulate Organics (UPO) from WW in the AD
sludge bed.
(4)    90%  of biodegraded COD converted to methane, 10% to biomass.
(5)    Effluent COD is unbiodegradable soluble organics (USO) plus unutilized
FBSO.

 This simple model will be COD, N and P mass balanced.
 Exiting COD = methane COD + effluent COD + sludge waste COD = Influent COD
 Effluent FSA = influent FSA + Organic N in the utilized FBSO and BPO (which
become FSA) minus N taken up by biomass production (which is very small but we
can include it without difficulty).
 Effluent TKN = Effluent FSA + N in unutilized FBSO + N in USO.
 Sludge waste TKN = N in UPO + N in biomass.
 Effluent OP = influent OP + Organic P in the utilized FBSO and BPO (which
become OPO) minus P taken up by biomass production (which is very small but we
can include it without difficulty).
 Effluent TP = Effluent OP + P in unutilized FBSO + P in USO (usually zero).
 Sludge waste TP = P in UPO + P in biomass.

  It is not difficult to do but will take me two days(??, which I don’t really
have but since we have put our hand to the plough we had better finish the
furrow).
  I would generate the equations in an Excel speeadsheet which Lluis & Lluis
can then code into the language they use.

   Let me know what you think of this approach.
