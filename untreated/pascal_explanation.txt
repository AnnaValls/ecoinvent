Hi Lluís, Lluís,

I had a closer look and made a slight adjustment in our method.

The column Q provides information about sewer connections. Since we are only
interested in wastewater being sent to sewers, this is our denominator.
The column R provides the total fraction of wastewater that is directly
collected by sewers but dumped in rivers without treatment.

What I need from you is the ratio Column R/Column Q. It is country specific:
therefore, if a user selects country X, then please use the corresponding row
in the table.

There are values for 2000 and 2015 - please use 2015 values.

I will do the rest of the calculations in Python for ecoSpold generation. This
does not affect your calculations.
(What does influence your calculations is the fraction lost to Combined Sewer
Overflow, CSO, which we discussed last week already.)

I attach a file that maps the ecoinvent regions to countries. This will allow
you to identify what data to use.
Notes on geography:
- There is a "World" region at the bottom of the table. We will be using this
for "Global" datasets.
- There are "Regional" data at the bottom of the table. We can use these for
"regions" in ecoinvent (for example RER, RNA, etc.).
The mapping should be rather straightforward with the Excel attached.

Let me know if you have any other questions.

All the best,
Pascal
