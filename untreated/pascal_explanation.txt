Finally, once the calculation is done on the right WW, I think you will be 
ready to send me data from the tool. 
Specifically, I need, for the untreated fraction ecoSpold:

"untreated_fraction"  (float between 0 and 1, from the UNICEF spreadsheet, a dummy value from your part would do for now)
"CSO_particulate"     (float between 0 and 1, directly from the tool)
"CSO_dissolved"       (float between 0 and 1, directly from the tool)
"CSO_amounts"         (dict of calculated discharged amounts. I will convert these to emissions to the environment)
"geography",          (string, code representing the country, from the "simplified_data_entry" page)
"PV"                  (float, the production volume from the "simplified_data_entry" page)
"WW_properties"       (dict with ecoinvent_property_id: amount_in_kg_per_m3, taken from the "simplified_data_entry" page)
