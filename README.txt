# ECOINVENT WEB TOOL for wastewater

In development. Expected web application finish: October 31 2017

## Tasks
### backend tasks
- [doing] implement elementary flows factors (lcorominas gathered equations)
- [to do] implement Fe/P mole ratio from figure 6-13 (page 484)
- [on hold] implement "simple treat" equations for other elementary flows factors
- [done] calculate area from mlss in reactor sizing
- [done] pack technology code in a reusable coding interface

### frontend tasks
- [to do] unify inputs in a single page, then, select technology, then run technology combination

### non prioratary tasks
- [to do] substitute images for text in implementations
- [to do] add references to metcalf in implementations
- [done] create a summary of terms (BOD, sBOD, ...)

### future
